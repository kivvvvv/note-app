# Note App
This project is one of my showcases of using React, a frontend framework, to illustrate some skills that I've learn through out the time that I spend on self-studying in order to switch my career into the web development field. It also acts as a confirmation/verification of my knowledge which will help me to develop the realworld application in the near future.
